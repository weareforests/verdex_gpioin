================================================================

VERDEX-GPIOIN allows the state of GPIO pins 58-73 to be monitored from within PD (or pd-anywhere).

These GPIO pins are broken out on the audiostix board as LDD0-LDD15.

=================================================================
WARNING! DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE WITH ANY COMPUTER OTHER THAN A GUMSTIX VERDEX
HARDWARE DAMAGE IS POSSIBLE BY MANIPULATION OF GPIO PORTS ON EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

To use- 

1. copy verdex_gpioin.pd_linux and verdex_gpioin-help.pd to:
        EITHER the same folder as your patch, or the PD extras folder (/usr/lib/pd/extra)

2. connect a (~47k?) resistor from the LDD pin you are using to GND (pulldown resistor)

3. connect a push-to-make switch from VCC to the LDD pin

4. poll the external in PD as in the help file. verdex_gpioin will output a 0 or 1 when the GPIO state changes

5. use a higher or lower poll rate for quicker response/ more 'debounce'
